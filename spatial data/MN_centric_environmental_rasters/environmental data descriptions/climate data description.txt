Current (Historical) Climate: https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html

This is WorldClim version 2.1 climate data for 1970-2000. This version was released in January 2020.

There are monthly climate data for minimum, mean, and maximum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, water vapor pressure, and for total precipitation. There are also 19 “bioclimatic” variables.

The data is available at the four spatial resolutions, between 30 seconds (~1 km2) to 10 minutes (~340 km2). Each download is a “zip” file containing 12 GeoTiff (.tif) files, one for each month of the year (January is 1; December is 12).

Processing:
1. Downloaded and extracted the pre-calculated bioclimatic variables at 2.5 min and 30 sec resolutions
2. Clipped to extent used for analysis (North America and Minnesota Centric -98,-89,43,50)
3. Reprojected into WGS84 if necessary
4. Exported as R rasters(.grd)
5. In R, stacked rasters and saved as a Raster Brick


Future Climate Projections: https://www.worldclim.org/data/cmip6/cmip6climate.html

The data available here are CMIP6 downscaled future climate projections. The downscaling and calibration (bias correction) was done with WorldClim v2.1 as baseline climate.
Monthly values of minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation were processed for nine global climate models (GCMs): BCC-CSM2-MR, CNRM-CM6-1, CNRM-ESM2-1, CanESM5, GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC-ES2L, MIROC6, MRI-ESM2-0, and for four Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs): 126, 245, 370 and 585.
The monthly values were averages over 20 year periods (2021-2040, 241-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100). The following spatial resolutions are available (expressed as minutes of a degree of longitude and latitude): 10 minutes, 5 minutes, 2.5 minutes.

Processing:
1. Downloaded and extracted the pre-calculated bioclimatic variables for 2.5 min resolution for all GCMs, SSPs, and time frames for which they were available (more info on SSPs in other document)
2. Clipped to extent used for analysis (North America and Minnesota Centric -98,-89,43,50)
3. Reprojected into WGS84 if necessary
4. Exported as R rasters(.grd)
