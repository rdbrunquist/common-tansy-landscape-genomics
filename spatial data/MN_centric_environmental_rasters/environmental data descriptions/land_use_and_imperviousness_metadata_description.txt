Land Classification:
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released five National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nationâ€™s land cover and land cover change.

Processing:
1. Downloaded and extracted data
2. Reprojected from Albers conical to WGS84
3. Clipped to an Minnesota centric bounding box (-98, 43, -89, 50)
4. Resampled to either 30sec or 2.5 minutes using nearest neighbor methods

Imperviousness: NLCD imperviousness products represent urban impervious surfaces as a percentage of developed surface over every 30-meter pixel in the United States.
